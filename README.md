# World-Life-Expectancy

## Project Overview 
In this project, I conducted an analysis of world life expectancy data with the primary objective of cleaning and exploring the dataset to uncover significant trends and correlations. The data was analyzed using Excel for preliminary exploration and MySQL for more advanced querying and analysis.

## Objective 
The main goal for this project was to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis to understand the underlying patterns and correlations between different variables. This exploration extended to calculating averages and examining the relationships between life expectancy and various socio-economic factors.

## Data 
- Excel Dataset [See It!](https://github.com/SophiaBuseski/World-Life-Expectancy/blob/main/WLF%20Data.csv)
- Raw Code [See It!](https://github.com/SophiaBuseski/World-Life-Expectancy/blob/main/WLF%20Code) 

## Methodology 
  ### 1. Data Cleaning: 
  I initiated the project with a thorough data cleaning process. This process began with loading and initial inspections of data. Then I went to handle any missing values, correct data types, and ensure consistency across the dataset with formatting.
     
 ### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
 I employed SQL queries to explore the dataset, identify key trends, and calculate statistical measures.
     
  ### 3. Correlation Analysis: 
  I calculated correlations between life expectancy and variables such as GDP and BMI, and segmented the data by year, GDP level, and development status of
  countries.

## Key Findings 
  ### 1. Life Expectancy Trends: 
  The global average life expectancy increased from 67.5 years in 2007 to 71.62 years in 2022.
     
  ### 2. GDP Correlation: 
  A strong positive correlation was found between GDP and life expectancy. Countries with a GDP over 1,500 had an average life expectancy of 74.20 years, while
  those with lower GDPs had an average life expectancy of 64.70 years.
     
  ### 3. Development Status Impact:
  In developing countries, the average life expectancy was 66.8 years compared to 79.2 years in developed countries.
     
  ### 4. BMI Correlation:
  There was also a notable correlation between life expectancy and BMI, indicating the influence of health and nutrition on longevity.

## Impact 
The insights from this project highlight the critical role of economic development and infrastructure in improving life expectancy. These findings can be valuable for policymakers and health organizations aiming to enhance life expectancy rates by focusing on economic growth, infrastructure development, and health interventions. Additionally, this analysis provides a foundational understanding of how socio-economic factors influence longevity, which can guide future research and policy formulation.

By leveraging SQL for data exploration and analysis, this project underscores the importance of robust data handling and analytical skills in deriving actionable insights from complex datasets.
